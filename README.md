Calculating statistical power using simr and public datasets

This is the code for a project about calculating statistical power using simr and public datasets. This was created for masked priming lexical decision task experiments investigating small effect sizes, and an explanation of the project can be found here: https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/items/535f7ac3-1783-4ca8-bdf3-0ca6487baa87

The code includes examples of how to use simr to calculate power for different levels of items and participants, as well as functions to find and change the effect size in the dataset.

simr was created by Peter Green and Catriona J. MacLeod, and the citation for the package can be found here: Green, P., & MacLeod, C. J.

The data used in this project are from a masked priming lexical decision task experiment investigating the effect of case alternation on word recognition.
